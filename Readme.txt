This program calculates and display a summary of the amount a user spent and helps them have an idea of how much money they spend from their income.

This application uses a text file to store the data used in the application.

I created this application as a final project for one of my courses. Because of this, in addition to the text files i created a small database with one table with test data for twelve months, so that the professor can fill the textboxes with this data without inserting values to all the input fields. For this you have to go to Edit/Options and check the Default Values checkbox to enable it and click the apply button. You still have to enter a name in the name textbox. After that you choose any month number from the dropdown textbox it appears and it will fill the textboxes with data for that month.
